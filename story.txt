Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on me, I thought I would walk about
a little and see the better part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
body and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the future;
whenever it is a snowy, cold November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
sleeping before coffin time, and bringing up the rear of every line I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately entering into the story, and methodically
reading people's words off—then, I account it high time to get to home as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all succeed in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the house with me. 
And I also cherish the same feelings toward them as well.
